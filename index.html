                    My name is Javon Peart, and I am a student pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in 
                    Spanish at the University of the West Indies. During my time in high school, I was required to write on literary 
                    novels and other media sources while adhering to specific writing styles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of my education  endeavors, I find myself taking pleasure in playing the piano and writing poetry. Both of which allow me to express myself 
                    and emotions in a way that simple conversations are not able to, with the later of the two bearing the greatest applicability.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    There is much to be said about the environment and the people who work together to produce high quality work. 
                    The report presented by ABC Nightline captured this idea in a remarkably refreshing way. Withing  the walls 
                    of the IDEO company, there is a diverse family of persons that, sometimes, share no personal or educational 
                    background. This mixture of skills and wisdom appears to drive the business, rather than destroy it, as the 
                    perspectives that each person offers during times of product development wanes away from a hive-minded set 
                    of thoughts and leans towards an interactive session where each person's input is genuinely considered.

                <h2>Critical Reading and Writing Blog Post</h2>

                <p>In addition to source evaluation, the second lesson that I learned in this course that I will expound 
                    upon is how to write acceptable pieces that appropriately address a target audience. Some of my earlier 
                    lectures in this course placed great emphasis on the importance of audience in writing.
                </p>
                <p>We spent a lot 
                    of time as a class reading through example media and reviewing it among ourselves for the appropriate 
                    use of language and expression regarding the target audience. I had some concept of audience consideration 
                    when it comes to written media but the activities that we were exposed to educated me on a greater importance 
                    of audience.
                </p>  
                <p>idea of “keeping your audience in mind”, to use my own words, liberally forced me as a 
                    writer to make necessary changes to the language, grammar and the use of jargons when writing scientific pieces
                    to ensure my target audience is reached fittingly.
